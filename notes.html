########################### CSS box model ####################################
1. margin:- spacing on the outside of the element ############################
2. padding:- spacing on the inside of the element around the text ############
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### box model hierarchy:- margin --> border --> padding --> text #############
### vertical-align: top - used to align everything in to the top #############
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
############################ TEXT-STYLES #####################################
## paragraphs by default comes with margins at top and bottom ################
## property settings which comes below overrides the setting of above ########
## but with CSS specificity, we can conclude that the Selector that's more
specific has higher priority. More specific means it targets the smaller groups
of elements. For eg: class name selector > element name selector. ############
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## text elements :- elements that exists inside the line of texts #############
## span :- most generic text element that has no style. #######################
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Block elements :- takes up the entire line in their container. eg: p, div ##
## Inline-block elements:- only takes up as much space as needed. Doesn't take
up entire line. eg: img, input ################################################
## Inline element:- Appear within a line of text . eg: strong, span ###########
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Nested layout techniques -> vertical layout and horizontal layout ##########
## Grid: used to create perfectly aligned horizontal layouts. It is a layout
that has rows and columns. More rigid as it depends on column numbers definition
## Flex: by default, vertical. justify-content: used to determine how the
elements are aligned horizontally. default is start. other values are start,
end, space-between. align-items: used to determine how the elements are aligned
vertically. default is stretch. other values are start, end, center. eg.
align-items: center -- elements are vertically centered in this case. ########
## position: property to determine the position of the element. default is
static. eg. static, fixed, absolute, relative. position property has four
special properties: top, left, right, bottom. for eg: left:0 tells how much
space is between the element and left edge of the browser window(or page in
absolute case). If we set it in opposite direction, the element will stretch.
fixed: element is fixed and floats in same position and placed in browser
window. absolute: same as fixed but placed in page. When we scroll, browser
window does not move but rather page moves. imp: if position absolute is inside
the position fixed, it behaves relative to the position fixed element. Also if
position absolute is inside the position relative, it behaves relative to that
position relative element as well but position relative element will be deplayed
normally. i.e scrolls with page. ###############################################
## z-index: elements written below is appeared in the front of the above
element. but this rule doesnot apply to position static elements. i.e position
static always appears at the back. but if it's relative or fixed, and written
below, it appears in the front of the above element. However, this can be
controlled by using z-index. Default value of z-index is 0. the higher the
value, the front it will be appeared at.
